SMART PHONE BASED MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR A MOBILE VAN COMMUNITY LIBRARY
In the current approach of mobile libraries, there is no digital method of running the whole system, instead everything is done manually. As was the case in Garissa, Bondo and Urban Kenyan regions, the caravans do a route on specific days and times. On a particular day once the caravan reaches a particular area, they stop and mount their utilities which there after follows by people coming to read. This has a couple of defects among them being, reach of the service to every individual in the community, management system of the books for borrowing and thereafter collection and finally a communication barrier between the librarians and the readers.
Limited technology integration poses a significant challenge for mobile libraries, impeding their ability to provide efficient and user-friendly services. The absence of a comprehensive catalog system and intuitive interfaces hinders readers’ access to library resources. Without a mobile application or online platform, users may struggle to browse the collection, place holds on desired items, or receive timely updates on the mobile library’s schedule and location.
Moreover, the lack of real-time communication channels and interactive features diminishes user engagement. Readers are often unable to easily communicate with library staff, ask questions or receive assistance remotely. This does not only affect the quality of customer service but also diminishes the overall user experience.
A well-integrated technology solution should encompass a user-friendly mobile app or web interface, offering features like a searchable catalog, online account management and push notifications on the mobile libraries geo-location among others. By incorporating technology, mobile libraries can enhance accessibility, streamline circulation services and foster a more engaging and interactive relationship with the community and ultimately fulfilling their mission of literacy promotion.
